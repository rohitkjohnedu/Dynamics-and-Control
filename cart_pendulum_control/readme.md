# The Pendulum cart
It is pendulum fixed on a moving cart. This folder contains two notebooks which derive the dynamics equations using two approaches: Langrangian dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. I am using sympy to derive them symbolically

Following this, the pendulum is controlled using a linear controller, to balance the penedulum vertically.

The segway could be considered an application of this concept. Its dynamics and control are derived in the notebook named segway
